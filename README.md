Notes
•	This code assumes the availability of the fetch API for making asynchronous requests.
•	The code uses a mock API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) for demonstration purposes. Replace it with your actual API endpoint.
•	Customize the thresholds and adjustment logic based on your specific requirements and design preferences. Adjustments can be made in the adjustThresholds function.
•	Ensure that the provided URL for fetching data is accessible and returns the expected JSON response.
